# Project


How to run:

First install ant if you don't have it.
Then unzip the asp.zip.
Do the following from a terminal: 

$ cd asp <br />
$ ant <br />
$ java -jar asp.jar aspfile.asp <br />
  
There are a few different asp files in the directory, like heron.asp and gcd.asp. 
Some of them don't output very much but they generate all log-files
with more interesting information.
