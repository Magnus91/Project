# Project


How to run:

First install ant if you don't have it.
Then unzip the asp.zip.
Do the following from a terminal: 
$ cd asp
$ ant 
$ java -jar asp.jar <filename>.asp
  
There are a few different asp-files in the directory. 
Some of them don't output very much but they generate all log-files
with more interesting information.
